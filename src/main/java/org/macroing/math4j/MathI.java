/**
 * The class {@code MathI} contains methods for performing basic numeric operations.
 * <p>
 * You can think of this class as an extension of {@code Math}. It does what {@code Math} does for the {@code int} type. In addition to this it also adds new methods.
 * <p>
 * This class does not contain all methods from {@code Math}. The methods in {@code Math} that deals with the {@code double} type can be found in the class {@link MathD}. The methods in {@code Math} that deals with the {@code float} type can be found in
 * the class {@link MathF}.
 * <p>
 * The documentation in this class should be comprehensive. But some of the details covered in the documentation of the {@code Math} class may be missing. To get the full documentation for a particular method, you may want to look at the documentation
 * of the corresponding method in the {@code Math} class. This is, of course, only true if the method you're looking at exists in the {@code Math} class.
 * <p>
 * Not all methods in the {@code Math} class that should be added to this class, may have been added yet.
 * 
 * @since 1.0.0
