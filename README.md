Math4J v.0.0.4
==============
Math4J is a simple mathematics library for Java.

The mathematical concepts covered are mainly those used in 3D-graphics, such as vectors, points and matrices. This is the field from which this library originated.

Note
----
This library hasn't been released yet. So, even though it says it's version 1.0.0 in all Java source code files, it shouldn't be treated as such. When this library reaches version 1.0.0, it will be tagged and available on the "releases" page.
